Hello @${author},

Thank you for summoning me.
However, I wasn't able to upvote the post because:
${flags.isCertifiedUlogger  ? "" : "1. You're not a certified ulogger."}
${flags.isFirstTagUlog      ? "" : "1. #ulog is not the first tag of this post."}
${flags.isSubtagOverseer    ? "" : `1. You're not an overseer of #${subtag}.`}
${flags.isUlogApp           ? "" : "1. The post was not submitted through [ulogs.org](https://ulogs.org)."}
${flags.isReplyToPost       ? "" : "1. You did not reply directly to the post."}
${flags.isValidWeight       ? "" : "1. You did not specify a valid vote weight."}

Please consider reaching out to @surpassinggoogle to address this.
